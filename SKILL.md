# Regret Minimization Framework

Evaluate major life and career decisions by projecting to age 80 and minimizing lifetime regrets about inaction. This is the framework Jeff Bezos used to decide to leave D.E. Shaw and start Amazon.

---

## When to Use

- Major career decision (job change, starting a company, major pivot)
- High-stakes personal choice with fear of failure
- User expresses "Should I take this risk?"
- Analysis paralysis on a significant life decision
- Request for "regret minimization" analysis
- Fear of failure competing with fear of missing out

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| decision | Yes | The major decision being considered |
| options | No | Specific alternatives (will be clarified if not provided) |
| fears | No | What's causing hesitation |
| context | No | Life stage, current situation, constraints |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Origin

In 1994, Jeff Bezos was a senior vice president at D.E. Shaw, a quantitative hedge fund, earning a substantial salary with a bonus about to vest. He had an idea to sell books on the internet. His boss, David Shaw, advised him that it was a good idea "for someone who didn't already have a good job."

Bezos developed the Regret Minimization Framework to make the decision.

### Step 2: The Core Question

Project yourself to age 80. Look back on your life. Ask:

**"Will I regret NOT trying this?"**

Not "Will I regret trying and failing?" - but specifically, will I regret never having attempted it at all?

### Step 3: Bezos's Words

"I knew that if I failed I wouldn't regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day."

"I wanted to minimize the number of regrets I had. When you think about the things you'll regret when you're 80, they're almost always the things you didn't do. They're acts of omission."

### Step 4: Key Insight

We rarely regret our failures. We regret our inactions. The things we didn't try. The risks we didn't take. The conversations we didn't have. The paths we didn't explore.

At 80, you won't remember the sting of a failed venture. You will remember - and regret - the life you didn't live because you were afraid.

## Assessment Framework

### Step 1: Project to 80

Close your eyes. Imagine you are 80 years old. You're looking back on a long life. You have perspective now that you don't have today.

### Step 2: The Inaction Scenario

From age 80, imagine you didn't take the risk. You played it safe. Ask:
- Do I regret not trying?
- Does it haunt me?
- Do I wonder "what if?"
- Did I let fear decide?

### Step 3: The Action Scenario

From age 80, imagine you took the risk and it failed. Ask:
- Do I regret having tried?
- Did I learn something valuable?
- Was the experience itself worthwhile?
- Can I live with having given it my best shot?

### Step 4: Compare Regrets

Which is worse at age 80?
- The regret of trying and failing?
- The regret of never trying at all?

For most meaningful decisions, the regret of inaction far exceeds the regret of failure.

### Step 5: Make the Decision

If the 80-year-old version of you would regret not trying, the answer is clear. Take the risk. The framework has spoken.

## When This Framework Applies

### Strong Fit

- Career pivots (leaving stable job for opportunity)
- Entrepreneurship decisions (starting a company)
- Major creative projects (writing a book, launching something)
- Relationship decisions (reaching out, having hard conversations)
- Adventure/experience decisions (travel, challenges)
- Learning new skills late in career

### Poor Fit

- Reversible decisions (use Type 1/Type 2 instead)
- Purely financial decisions (use expected value analysis)
- Decisions affecting others without their consent
- Decisions made from impulse rather than genuine calling
- Escapism disguised as opportunity

## Constraints

- This framework is for major, meaningful decisions - not everyday choices
- The question is about regret of inaction, not probability of success
- Fear of failure is not a valid reason to avoid trying
- Financial security concerns are valid but often solvable
- The framework assumes genuine opportunity, not recklessness
- Some risks are genuinely bad ideas - the framework doesn't override judgment

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "I'm 35, VP at a tech company, good salary. I have an idea for a startup but I'm afraid to leave my stable job and fail. My spouse is supportive but nervous. We have savings for about 18 months."

**Output:**

## Regret Minimization Analysis

### The Decision
Leave VP position at stable tech company to pursue startup idea.

### Current Situation
35 years old, established career, financial stability, supportive spouse, 18 months runway. The window for this type of risk is open but not forever.

### The Fear
- Failure after leaving a good job
- Embarrassment of returning to corporate life
- Burning savings
- Letting spouse down

### Projection to 80

**Scenario A: You didn't take the risk**
At 80, you look back. Your career was fine. You made VP, maybe SVP. Good salary. Good benefits. But there's that idea you never tried. You watched someone else build something similar. You still wonder what would have happened. Every time you see a founder story, there's a small sting. "That could have been me." You played it safe. You'll never know what was possible.

The regret: "I had the idea. I had the savings. I had the support. And I let fear decide for me."

**Scenario B: You took the risk and it failed**
At 80, you look back. You left the VP job. You gave it 18 months. It didn't work - maybe the market wasn't ready, maybe execution was off, maybe just bad luck. You went back to corporate life, a bit humbler, a lot wiser. You learned more in 18 months of building than in 5 years of corporate ladder-climbing.

The regret: Minimal. You tried. You know. You have no "what ifs." The failure was a chapter, not the story.

**Scenario C: You took the risk and it succeeded**
At 80, you look back at the company you built. The people whose lives you changed. The problems you solved. The wealth you created. Leaving that VP job was the best decision you ever made.

### The Verdict

**Which regret is worse?**
Scenario A - not trying - is clearly worse. In Scenario B, you have an answer. In Scenario A, you have a haunting question.

**What would 80-year-old you say?**
"You have savings. You have support. You have an idea you believe in. What exactly are you waiting for? The window is open now. It won't be open forever. Try. If it fails, you'll have learned and you can return to corporate life. If you don't try, you'll never know."

### Recommendation

**TAKE THE RISK**

**Reasoning:** You have 18 months of runway, a supportive spouse, an idea you believe in, and the skills to execute. The failure scenario is survivable - you return to corporate life with new skills and no "what ifs." The inaction scenario creates permanent regret about a path not taken. At 80, you will not regret trying and failing. You will regret never trying.

### If Taking the Risk

**To minimize downside:**
1. Set a clear 18-month evaluation point - decide in advance what success/failure looks like
2. Stay networked with former colleagues for potential return path
3. Don't burn bridges - leave current job professionally
4. Define the "pull the plug" criteria before emotions get involved

**First action to take:**
Write down what the startup would look like if it succeeded. Make it concrete. Then tell three trusted people you're considering it. Making it real starts with making it spoken.

### The Bezos Reminder

"I knew that if I failed I wouldn't regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day."
